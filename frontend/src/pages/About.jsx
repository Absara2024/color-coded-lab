      <p className="mt-4">ReConnect is a community-driven platform designed to reunite East African high school alumni, wherever life has taken them. Our mission is simple: to bridge the gap between the past and the present by creating a space where old classmates can reconnect, reminisce, and rebuild lifelong friendships.

Whether you studied in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, or any part of East Africa, this app is your digital reunion space. We understand the unique bond formed during those high school years, and we're here to make sure those memories and connections live on.

With features like class group chats, alumni directories, event announcements, and more, ReConnect is more than just a social appâ€”it's a celebration of shared history and culture.

Join us as we bring together generations of East African scholars. Reconnect with your roots, your friends, and your story.</p>
